# Final Project Description

## Project Motivation
Due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of urban logistics, combined with the challenges in freight data collection, there is a general lack of information on the movement and activity behaviour of commercial vehicles. However, this information is crucial in helping urban authorities and policymakers understand the factors that contribute to the dwell time of commercial vehicles and the resulting implications for traffic congestion in the area. With the recent advancements in information and communication technology, this has led to the ubiquitous use of mobile sensing devices, such as smartphones and vehicles trackers, to obtain high-resolution movement data of commercial vehicles to support the conduct of large-scale freight studies.

## Data Requirement
Using a digital data collection platform known as the Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) platform, we were able to obtain the GPS traces and stop activity information of heavy goods vehicles operating within Singapore. The resulting dataset that will be used for this final project has been verified by the drivers of the tracked vehicles and has been cleaned of any noise or missing information.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of the project is to develop a visualisation system to explore the dataset collected through the FMS platform and, where appropriate, communicate specific insights about the activity patterns and stop duration of commercial vehicles operating within Singapore.
